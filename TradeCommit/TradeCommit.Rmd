# Recent US-China conflict  <br><br>
<!-- include an image here, if you have a GitHub account use your profile pic! -->

Bilateral trade has expanded over 100 times

However, security concerns also rise

# Bilateral trade and costly conflict <br><br>

--

Current studies focus on costs

--

Empirically, conditional pacifying effects


--

Different commodities entail different costs

- Easy to plunder

- Easy to find alternatives (highly elastic)

---

class: center, middle

# 5G technology or microchips are neither easily appropriable nor highly elastic




---

class: center, middle

# But they can shift military power


---
# Concept of security externality <br><br>

States' increased abilities to translate trade gains
into (latent) military power due to the expansion of trade


---

# Theory <br><br>

--

Peace-promoting when relative externality is at the extremes

--

Conflict-aggravating when at a mid-range

--

Marginal effects of trade conditional and .blue[inverted U] shape

---

# Empirics <br><br>

Sample: .blue[rivalry]

Outcome: MIDs

IV: trade, .blue[externality]

Controls: total trade, power ratio, distance, alliance, democracy, Cold war


---

# Externality <br><br>

--

Strategic goods


Manufactured goods


Trade networks (integration)

$$\large\begin{equation}
		\texttt{Externality} = \texttt{$\sum_{i}^{} \texttt{Strategic goods}_{i} \times \texttt{Integration}_{i}$}

# Conclusion <br><br>


--

Scope condition (reversed)


--

Current focus on costs misses externatlity

--

Power shift over time is critical
